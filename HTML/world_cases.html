      <h4>How It Spreads!</h4>
      <p>
        The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small
        liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These
        particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
        You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone
        who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your
        eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in
        crowded settings.

      <h4>World Cases</h4>
      <p>
        The virus has now been around for 4 years. It keeps on coming in waves
        and variants as the world tries to recover in all ways, from financial
        to emotional. Though the toll it has taken is massive, we continue to
        fight it and heal ourselves and the ones around us. Whatever it takes.
